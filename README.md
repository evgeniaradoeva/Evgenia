<h1>Creative computing?! A learning log</h1>

<h2>First thouhts</h2>
This week was probably the most difficult one for me, because I feel a bit far from this specific part of graphic design (which to be honest I didn’t even know was a part of graphic design)

On Monday a whole new door opened in my mind. It is still half closed though, because of the confusion that envelops me, when I try to fully open it. New terms were flying around- Read me file?; Arduino?; Tinkercad?

<h2>Arduino</h2>
The first time trying to use the Arduino kit I got very overwhelmed by the way it looks and all the unfamiliar cables, buttons and so on. But then when the circuit I tried actually worked, I got filled with excitement and decided to try some more.

I wanted to do something more difficult with it (ask me why) and asked for help from a friend. After 4 hours of trying to understand the code that was send to me, trying to work with it and the countless times the little red light for “error” appeared, I gave up. The next day I decided to give it another go and after another few hours I made two of the lights to light up in a certain beat. I feel like I definitely could have done more with it for the time I spent. But I learned that even little things take a lot of time. I must say that I had some fun with it, so don’t give up!

After the work with the Arduino I was still confused about why I need this. Then I researched some more and realised that almost everything around us is connected to creative computing and even though I am not as interested in it, people produce beautiful art, using it’s resources. Such as ASCII art (it's images created only through text characters, specifically the 128 characters specified in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a character encoding standard for electronic communication), NFT (a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, which can be sold and traded. The NFT can be associated with a particular digital or physical asset such as a file or a physical object, and a license to use the asset for a specified purpose) and many more.

<h2>In conclusion</h2>
The whole journey this week has been rather confusing for me. I kind of understand what creative computing is, then when I think about it I actually don’t and that’s why I decided to make a little comics, describing my interaction with creative computing.
